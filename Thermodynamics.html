                <p class="intro-text"><b>Thermodynamics</b> is a branch of
                    physics
                    that deals with heat, work, and temperature, and their
                    relation to energy, entropy, and the physical properties
                    of matter and radiation. The behavior of these
                    quantities is governed by the four laws of
                    thermodynamics, which convey a quantitative description
                    using measurable macroscopic physical quantities, but
                    may be explained in terms of microscopic constituents by
                    statistical mechanics. Thermodynamics applies to a wide
                    variety of topics in science and engineering, especially
                    physical chemistry, biochemistry, chemical engineering
                    and mechanical engineering, but also in other complex
                    fields such as meteorology.</p>

                    Historically, thermodynamics developed out of a desire
                    to increase the efficiency of early steam engines,
                    particularly through the work of French physicist Sadi
                    Carnot (1824) who believed that engine efficiency was
                    the key that could help France win the Napoleonic
                    Wars. Scots-Irish physicist Lord Kelvin was the first
                    to formulate a concise definition of thermodynamics in
                    1854 which stated,
                    "Thermo-dynamics is the subject of the relation of heat to forces acting between contiguous parts of
                    bodies, and the relation of heat to electrical agency."
                    German physicist and mathematician Rudolf Clausius
                    restated Carnot's principle known as the Carnot cycle
                    and gave to the theory of heat a truer and sounder
                    basis. His most important paper,
                    "On the Moving Force of Heat", published in 1850,
                    first stated the second law of thermodynamics. In 1865
                    he introduced the concept of entropy. In 1870 he
                    introduced the virial theorem, which applied to heat.

                <p><b>The zeroth law of thermodynamics states:</b> If two
                    systems are each in thermal equilibrium with a third,
                    they are also in thermal equilibrium with each
                    other.</p>

                <p><b>The first law of thermodynamics states:</b> In a
                    process
                    without transfer of matter, the change in internal
                    energy, <b>ΔU</b> , of a thermodynamics system is equal
                    to energy gained as heat, <b>Q</b>, less thermodynamics
                    work, <b>W</b>, done by the system on its surroundings.
                    <br>
                    ΔU = Q - W
                </p>

                <p><b>Second law of thermodynamics states:</b> Heat does not
                    spontaneously flow from a colder body to a hotter body.
                </p>

                <p><b>Third law of thermodynamics states:</b> As the
                    temperature of a system approaches absolute zero, all
                    processes cease and the entropy of the system approaches
                    a minimum value.
